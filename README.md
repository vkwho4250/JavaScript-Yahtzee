## Motivation

After a month in, the purpose of this project is to use my newly learned
developing skills on a practical application to test and better my current knowledge. It allowed me to set a goal, be creative and figure out what is needed to put it altogether. It also taught me equally (if not more) important concepts such as mass googling, debugging, commenting and cleaning code (oh, and patience **!important**)

From this, I've gained practice on **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Git** for version control.
